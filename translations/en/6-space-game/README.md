# Build a Space Game

A space game to teach advanced JavaScript fundamentals

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create your own space game. If you've ever played "Space Invaders," this game follows a similar concept: control a spaceship and shoot at monsters descending from above. Here's what the completed game will look like:

In these six lessons, you'll learn the following:

- **Interact** with the Canvas element to draw objects on the screen
- **Understand** the Cartesian coordinate system
- **Learn** the Pub-Sub pattern to design a game architecture that's easier to maintain and expand
- **Leverage** Async/Await to load game resources
- **Handle** keyboard events
