# Build a Space Game Part 2: Draw Hero and Monsters to Canvas

## Pre-Lecture Quiz

[Pre-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/web/quiz/31)

## The Canvas

The canvas is an HTML element that starts off empty; it's like a blank sheet of paper. You can add content to it by drawing on it.

âœ… Read [more about the Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) on MDN.

Here's how it's typically defined as part of the page's body:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```

In the code above, we are setting the `id`, `width`, and `height`.

- `id`: This allows you to reference the canvas when you need to interact with it.
- `width`: This defines the width of the canvas.
- `height`: This defines the height of the canvas.

## Drawing simple geometry

The canvas uses a Cartesian coordinate system to draw shapes. This means it uses an x-axis and y-axis to determine where things are placed. The position `0,0` is the top-left corner, and the bottom-right corner corresponds to the `width` and `height` of the canvas.

> Image from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes)

To draw on the canvas, follow these steps:

1. **Get a reference** to the canvas element.
2. **Get a reference** to the context object associated with the canvas.
3. **Perform a drawing operation** using the context object.

The code for these steps typically looks like this:

```javascript
// draws a red rectangle
//1. get the canvas reference
canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");

//2. set the context to 2D to draw basic shapes
ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

//3. fill it with the color red
ctx.fillStyle = 'red';

//4. and draw a rectangle with these parameters, setting location and size
ctx.fillRect(0,0, 200, 200) // x,y,width, height
```

âœ… The Canvas API is primarily designed for 2D graphics, but you can also create 3D graphics on a webpage using the [WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

With the Canvas API, you can draw a variety of things, such as:

- **Geometric shapes**: We've already shown how to draw a rectangle, but there are many other shapes you can create.
- **Text**: You can draw text in any font and color you like.
- **Images**: You can display images from assets like `.jpg` or `.png` files.

âœ… Try it! Now that you know how to draw a rectangle, can you draw a circle on the page? Check out some creative Canvas drawings on CodePen. Here's a [particularly impressive example](https://codepen.io/dissimulate/pen/KrAwx).

## Load and draw an image asset

To load an image asset, create an `Image` object and set its `src` property. Then, listen for the `load` event to know when the image is ready to use. The code looks like this:

### Load asset

```javascript
const img = new Image();
img.src = 'path/to/my/image.png';
img.onload = () => {
  // image loaded and ready to be used
}
```

### Load asset pattern

It's a good idea to wrap the code above in a reusable structure, so you can easily use it and ensure the image is fully loaded before manipulating it:

```javascript
function loadAsset(path) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = path;
    img.onload = () => {
      // image loaded and ready to be used
      resolve(img);
    }
  })
}

// use like so

async function run() {
  const heroImg = await loadAsset('hero.png')
  const monsterImg = await loadAsset('monster.png')
}

```

To draw game assets on the screen, your code might look like this:

```javascript
async function run() {
  const heroImg = await loadAsset('hero.png')
  const monsterImg = await loadAsset('monster.png')

  canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.drawImage(heroImg, canvas.width/2,canvas.height/2);
  ctx.drawImage(monsterImg, 0,0);
}
```

## Now it's time to start building your game

### What to build

You will create a webpage with a canvas element. The canvas should display a black screen with dimensions `1024x768`. We've provided two images for you:

- Hero ship:

   ![Hero ship](../../../../translated_images/player.dd24c1afa8c71e9b82b2958946d4bad13308681392d4b5ddcc61a0e818ef8088.en.png)

- 5x5 monster grid:

   ![Monster ship](../../../../translated_images/enemyShip.5df2a822c16650c2fb3c06652e8ec8120cdb9122a6de46b9a1a56d54db22657f.en.png)

### Recommended steps to start development

Locate the files provided in the `your-work` subfolder. It should contain the following:

```bash
-| assets
  -| enemyShip.png
  -| player.png
-| index.html
-| app.js
-| package.json
```

Open this folder in Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have a local development environment set up, preferably with Visual Studio Code, NPM, and Node installed. If you don't have `npm` installed, [here's how to set it up](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Start your project by navigating to the `your_work` folder:

```bash
cd your-work
npm start
```

This will start an HTTP server at `http://localhost:5000`. Open a browser and go to that address. The page will be blank for now, but that will change soon.

> Note: To see updates on your screen, refresh your browser.

### Add code

Add the necessary code to `your-work/app.js` to complete the following tasks:

1. **Draw** a canvas with a black background.
   > Tip: Add two lines of code under the appropriate TODO in `/app.js` to set the `ctx` element's background to black. Set the top-left coordinates to `0,0` and the height and width to match the canvas dimensions.
2. **Load** textures.
   > Tip: Use `await loadTexture` to load the player and enemy images by passing their file paths. You won't see them on the screen just yet!
3. **Draw** the hero in the center of the screen, near the bottom.
   > Tip: Use the `drawImage` API to draw `heroImg` on the screen. Set the coordinates to `canvas.width / 2 - 45` and `canvas.height - canvas.height / 4`.
4. **Draw** a 5x5 grid of monsters.
   > Tip: Uncomment the code to draw enemies on the screen. Then, go to the `createEnemies` function and complete it.

   Start by defining some constants:

    ```javascript
    const MONSTER_TOTAL = 5;
    const MONSTER_WIDTH = MONSTER_TOTAL * 98;
    const START_X = (canvas.width - MONSTER_WIDTH) / 2;
    const STOP_X = START_X + MONSTER_WIDTH;
    ```

   Next, create a loop to draw the array of monsters on the screen:

    ```javascript
    for (let x = START_X; x < STOP_X; x += 98) {
        for (let y = 0; y < 50 * 5; y += 50) {
          ctx.drawImage(enemyImg, x, y);
        }
      }
    ```

## Result

The final result should look like this:

![Black screen with a hero and 5x5 monsters](../../../../translated_images/partI-solution.36c53b48c9ffae2a5e15496b23b604ba5393433e4bf91608a7a0a020eb7a2691.en.png)
