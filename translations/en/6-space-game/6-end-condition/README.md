# Build a Space Game Part 6: End and Restart

## Pre-Lecture Quiz

[Pre-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/web/quiz/39)

There are various ways to define an *end condition* in a game. As the creator, it's up to you to decide why the game ends. Here are some possible reasons, assuming we're talking about the space game you've been building so far:

- **`N` Enemy ships have been destroyed**: It's common in games divided into levels to require the destruction of `N` enemy ships to complete a level.
- **Your ship has been destroyed**: In some games, you lose if your ship is destroyed. Another common approach is to introduce the concept of lives. Each time your ship is destroyed, you lose a life. Once all lives are gone, the game ends.
- **You've collected `N` points**: Another typical end condition is reaching a certain number of points. Points can be earned in various ways, such as destroying enemy ships or collecting items dropped when ships are destroyed.
- **Complete a level**: This might involve multiple conditions, such as destroying `X` enemy ships, collecting `Y` points, or obtaining a specific item.

## Restarting

If players enjoy your game, they'll likely want to replay it. When the game ends for any reason, you should provide an option to restart.

âœ… Take a moment to think about the conditions under which a game ends and how you're prompted to restart.

## What to build

You will add the following rules to your game:

1. **Winning the game**: When all enemy ships are destroyed, the player wins. Display a victory message to indicate this.
2. **Restart**: When all lives are lost or the game is won, provide an option to restart. Remember to reinitialize the game and clear the previous game state.

## Recommended steps

Locate the files in the `your-work` subfolder. It should contain the following:

```bash
-| assets
  -| enemyShip.png
  -| player.png
  -| laserRed.png
  -| life.png
-| index.html
-| app.js
-| package.json
```

Start your project in the `your_work` folder by typing:

```bash
cd your-work
npm start
```

This will start an HTTP server at `http://localhost:5000`. Open a browser and navigate to that address. Your game should be in a playable state.

> tip: To avoid warnings in Visual Studio Code, edit the `window.onload` function to call `gameLoopId` as is (without `let`), and declare `gameLoopId` at the top of the file independently: `let gameLoopId;`

### Add code

1. **Track end condition**: Add code to track the number of enemies or whether the hero ship has been destroyed by adding these two functions:

    ```javascript
    function isHeroDead() {
      return hero.life <= 0;
    }

    function isEnemiesDead() {
      const enemies = gameObjects.filter((go) => go.type === "Enemy" && !go.dead);
      return enemies.length === 0;
    }
    ```

2. **Add logic to message handlers**: Update the `eventEmitter` to handle these conditions:

    ```javascript
    eventEmitter.on(Messages.COLLISION_ENEMY_LASER, (_, { first, second }) => {
        first.dead = true;
        second.dead = true;
        hero.incrementPoints();

        if (isEnemiesDead()) {
          eventEmitter.emit(Messages.GAME_END_WIN);
        }
    });

    eventEmitter.on(Messages.COLLISION_ENEMY_HERO, (_, { enemy }) => {
        enemy.dead = true;
        hero.decrementLife();
        if (isHeroDead())  {
          eventEmitter.emit(Messages.GAME_END_LOSS);
          return; // loss before victory
        }
        if (isEnemiesDead()) {
          eventEmitter.emit(Messages.GAME_END_WIN);
        }
    });
    
    eventEmitter.on(Messages.GAME_END_WIN, () => {
        endGame(true);
    });
      
    eventEmitter.on(Messages.GAME_END_LOSS, () => {
      endGame(false);
    });
    ```

3. **Add new message types**: Add these messages to the constants object:

    ```javascript
    GAME_END_LOSS: "GAME_END_LOSS",
    GAME_END_WIN: "GAME_END_WIN",
    ```

4. **Add restart code**: Implement code to restart the game when a specific button is pressed.

   1. **Listen for the `Enter` key press**: Update your window's eventListener to detect this key press:

        ```javascript
     else if(evt.key === "Enter") {
        eventEmitter.emit(Messages.KEY_EVENT_ENTER);
      }
    ```

   2. **Add a restart message**: Add this message to your Messages constant:

        ```javascript
        KEY_EVENT_ENTER: "KEY_EVENT_ENTER",
        ```

5. **Implement game rules**: Add the following game rules:

   1. **Player win condition**: When all enemy ships are destroyed, display a victory message.

      1. First, create a `displayMessage()` function:

        ```javascript
        function displayMessage(message, color = "red") {
          ctx.font = "30px Arial";
          ctx.fillStyle = color;
          ctx.textAlign = "center";
          ctx.fillText(message, canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 2);
        }
        ```

      2. Then, create an `endGame()` function:

        ```javascript
        function endGame(win) {
          clearInterval(gameLoopId);
        
          // set a delay so we are sure any paints have finished
          setTimeout(() => {
            ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
            ctx.fillStyle = "black";
            ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
            if (win) {
              displayMessage(
                "Victory!!! Pew Pew... - Press [Enter] to start a new game Captain Pew Pew",
                "green"
              );
            } else {
              displayMessage(
                "You died !!! Press [Enter] to start a new game Captain Pew Pew"
              );
            }
          }, 200)  
        }
        ```

   2. **Restart logic**: When all lives are lost or the player wins, display a message indicating the game can be restarted. Restart the game when the restart key is pressed (you can choose which key to use).

      1. Create the `resetGame()` function:

        ```javascript
        function resetGame() {
          if (gameLoopId) {
            clearInterval(gameLoopId);
            eventEmitter.clear();
            initGame();
            gameLoopId = setInterval(() => {
              ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
              ctx.fillStyle = "black";
              ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
              drawPoints();
              drawLife();
              updateGameObjects();
              drawGameObjects(ctx);
            }, 100);
          }
        }
        ```

      2. Add a call to the `eventEmitter` to reset the game in `initGame()`:

        ```javascript
        eventEmitter.on(Messages.KEY_EVENT_ENTER, () => {
          resetGame();
        });
        ```

      3. Add a `clear()` function to the EventEmitter:

        ```javascript
        clear() {
          this.listeners = {};
        }
        ```
