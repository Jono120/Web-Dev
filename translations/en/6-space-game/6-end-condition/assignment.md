# Build a Sample Game

## Instructions

Try creating a small game to practice different end conditions. Experiment with scenarios like reaching a certain number of points, the hero losing all lives, or defeating all monsters. Build something simple, such as a console-based adventure game. Use the game flow below as inspiration:

```
Hero> Strikes with broadsword - orc takes 3p damage
Orc> Hits with club - hero takes 2p damage
Hero> Kicks - orc takes 1p damage
Game> Orc is defeated - Hero collects 2 coins
Game> ****No more monsters, you have conquered the evil fortress****
```
