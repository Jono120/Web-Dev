# Explore Collisions

## Instructions

To gain a better understanding of how collisions work, create a small game with a few objects that collide. Make them move using key presses or mouse clicks, and ensure that something happens to one of the objects when it gets hit. For example, it could be a meteor crashing into the earth or bumper cars colliding. Be creative!
