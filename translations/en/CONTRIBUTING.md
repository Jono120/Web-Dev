# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which confirms that you have the rights to your contribution and that you grant us permission to use it. For more details, visit [https://cla.microsoft.com](https://cla.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically check if you need to provide a CLA and will update the PR accordingly (e.g., with a label or comment). Just follow the instructions provided by the bot. You only need to complete this process once for all repositories that use our CLA. Additionally, please try to explain the reason behind your changes so we can better understand your request.
