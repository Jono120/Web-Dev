# Event-Driven Programming - Build a Typing Game

## Introduction

Typing is one of the most overlooked skills for developers. Being able to quickly translate your thoughts into code allows your creativity to flow seamlessly. And what better way to practice than by playing a game?

> Let's build a typing game!

You'll use the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills you've learned so far to create a typing game. The game will display a random quote (we're using [Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) quotes) and measure how long it takes the player to type it accurately. You'll use the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills you've learned so far to create this game.
