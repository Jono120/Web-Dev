# Analyze an inaccessible site

## Instructions

Identify a website that you believe is NOT accessible and create an action plan to enhance its accessibility.  
Your first step is to identify this site, describe the ways in which you think it is inaccessible without using analytical tools, and then run a Lighthouse analysis on it. Save a PDF of the analysis results and create a detailed plan with at least ten points explaining how the site can be improved.

## Table to test site accessibility

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
|          | missing <10% of what is required | missing 20% of what is required | missing 50% of what is required |

----
Student Report: includes paragraphs describing how inaccessible the site is, the Lighthouse report saved as a PDF, a list of ten improvement points, and detailed explanations on how to implement them.
