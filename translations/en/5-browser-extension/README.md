# Building a browser extension

Creating browser extensions is an enjoyable and engaging way to explore app performance while developing a unique type of web asset. This module includes lessons on how browsers function, how to deploy a browser extension, how to create a form, interact with an API, utilize local storage, and assess and enhance your website's performance.

You'll develop a browser extension compatible with Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. This extension, essentially a mini website designed for a specific task, checks the [C02 Signal API](https://www.co2signal.com) to analyze electricity usage and carbon intensity for a given region, providing insights into the region's carbon footprint.

Users can manually activate this extension by entering an API key and region code into a form to assess local electricity usage. This data can help users make informed decisions about their electricity consumption. For instance, it might be better to postpone using a clothes dryer (a high-carbon activity) during times of peak electricity usage in your area.

## Credits

The idea for this web carbon trigger was inspired by Asim Hussain, leader of Microsoft's Green Cloud Advocacy team and author of the [Green Principles](https://principles.green/). It was initially a [web site project](https://github.com/jlooper/green).

The structure of the browser extension was influenced by [Adebola Adeniran's COVID extension](https://github.com/onedebos/covtension).

The concept for the 'dot' icon system was inspired by the icon design of the [Energy Lollipop](https://energylollipop.com/) browser extension for California emissions.
