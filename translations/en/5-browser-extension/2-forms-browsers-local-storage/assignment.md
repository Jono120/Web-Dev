# Adopt an API

## Instructions

APIs can be a lot of fun to experiment with. Here is a [list of many free ones](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Choose an API and create a browser extension that addresses a problem. It could be something as small as not having enough pictures of pets (in which case, try the [dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)) or something more significantâ€”just have fun with it!
