# CSS Refactoring

## Instructions

Restyle the terrarium using either Flexbox or CSS Grid, and take screenshots to demonstrate that you have tested it on multiple browsers. You may need to modify the markup, so create a new version of the app with the artwork in place for your refactor. Don't worry about making the elements draggable; for now, focus only on refactoring the HTML and CSS.
