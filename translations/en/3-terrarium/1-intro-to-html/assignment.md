# Practice your HTML: Build a blog mockup

## Instructions

Imagine you are designing or redesigning your personal website. Create a visual mockup of your site, and then write the HTML markup you would use to construct the various elements of the site. You can do this on paper and scan it, or use software of your choiceâ€”just make sure to hand-code the HTML markup.
