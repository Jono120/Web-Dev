# Operators

## Instructions

Experiment with operators. Here's an idea for a program you can create:

You have a group of students from two different grading systems.

### First grading system

One grading system uses grades ranging from 1 to 5, where a grade of 3 or higher means the student passes the course.

### Second grading system

The other grading system uses the grades `A, A-, B, B-, C, C-`, where `A` is the highest grade and `C` is the lowest passing grade.

### The task

Using the array `allStudents`, which represents all students and their grades, create a new array `studentsWhoPass` that includes only the students who pass.

> TIP: Use a for-loop, if...else statements, and comparison operators:

```javascript
let allStudents = [
  'A',
  'B-',
  1,
  4,
  5,
  2
]

let studentsWhoPass = [];
```
