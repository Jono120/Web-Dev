## A Brief Recap on Booleans

Booleans can only have two values: `true` or `false`. They are used to decide which lines of code should execute based on specific conditions.

You can set a Boolean value like this:

`let myTrueBool = true`  
`let myFalseBool = false`

âœ… Booleans are named after George Boole, an English mathematician, philosopher, and logician (1815â€“1864).

## Comparison Operators and Booleans

Operators are used to evaluate conditions by comparing values, resulting in a Boolean value. Below is a list of commonly used operators:

| Symbol | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Example            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `<`    | **Less than**: Compares two values and returns `true` if the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right                                         | `5 < 6 // true`    |
| `<=`   | **Less than or equal to**: Compares two values and returns `true` if the value on the left is smaller than or equal to the value on the right                 | `5 <= 6 // true`   |
| `>`    | **Greater than**: Compares two values and returns `true` if the value on the left is larger than the value on the right                                       | `5 > 6 // false`   |
| `>=`   | **Greater than or equal to**: Compares two values and returns `true` if the value on the left is larger than or equal to the value on the right               | `5 >= 6 // false`  |
| `===`  | **Strict equality**: Compares two values and returns `true` if both values are equal and of the same data type                                                | `5 === 6 // false` |
| `!==`  | **Inequality**: Compares two values and returns the opposite Boolean value of what a strict equality operator would return                                    | `5 !== 6 // true`  |

âœ… Test your understanding by writing some comparisons in your browser's console. Were any results unexpected?

## If Statement

The `if` statement executes the code within its block if the condition evaluates to `true`.

```javascript
if (condition) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
}
```

Logical operators are often used to create the condition.

```javascript
let currentMoney;
let laptopPrice;

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
}
```

## If..Else Statement

The `else` statement executes the code within its block when the condition is `false`. It is optional when using an `if` statement.

```javascript
let currentMoney;
let laptopPrice;

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
} else {
  //Condition is false. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Can't afford a new laptop, yet!");
}
```

âœ… Test your understanding of this code and the following code by running it in a browser console. Modify the values of the `currentMoney` and `laptopPrice` variables to see how the `console.log()` output changes.

## Switch Statement

The `switch` statement allows you to perform different actions based on different conditions. Use it to select one of many code blocks to execute.

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
  // code block
}
```

```javascript
// program using switch statement
let a = 2;

switch (a) {
  case 1:
    a = "one";
    break;
  case 2:
    a = "two";
    break;
  default:
    a = "not found";
    break;
}
console.log(`The value is ${a}`);
```

âœ… Test your understanding of this code and the following code by running it in a browser console. Modify the value of the variable `a` to see how the `console.log()` output changes.

## Logical Operators and Booleans

Sometimes decisions require multiple comparisons, which can be combined using logical operators to produce a Boolean value.

| Symbol | Description                                                                                     | Example                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&&`   | **Logical AND**: Compares two Boolean expressions. Returns `true` **only** if both sides are true | `(5 > 6) && (5 < 6) // One side is false, the other is true. Returns false` |
| `\|\|` | **Logical OR**: Compares two Boolean expressions. Returns `true` if at least one side is true     | `(5 > 6) \|\| (5 < 6) // One side is false, the other is true. Returns true` |
| `!`    | **Logical NOT**: Returns the opposite value of a Boolean expression                             | `!(5 > 6) // 5 is not greater than 6, but "!" will return true`         |

## Conditions and Decisions with Logical Operators

Logical operators can be used to create conditions in `if..else` statements.

```javascript
let currentMoney;
let laptopPrice;
let laptopDiscountPrice = laptopPrice - laptopPrice * 0.2; //Laptop price at 20 percent off

if (currentMoney >= laptopPrice || currentMoney >= laptopDiscountPrice) {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Getting a new laptop!");
} else {
  //Condition is true. Code in this block will run.
  console.log("Can't afford a new laptop, yet!");
}
```

### Negation Operator

You've seen how `if...else` statements can be used to create conditional logic. Anything inside an `if` must evaluate to `true` or `false`. The `!` operator allows you to _negate_ an expression, like this:

```javascript
if (!condition) {
  // runs if condition is false
} else {
  // runs if condition is true
}
```

### Ternary Expressions

`if...else` isn't the only way to express decision-making logic. You can also use a ternary operator, which has the following syntax:

```javascript
let variable = condition ? <return this if true> : <return this if false>
```

Here's a more practical example:

```javascript
let firstNumber = 20;
let secondNumber = 10;
let biggestNumber = firstNumber > secondNumber ? firstNumber : secondNumber;
```

âœ… Take a moment to read this code carefully. Do you understand how these operators work?

The example above states:

- If `firstNumber` is greater than `secondNumber`,  
  assign `firstNumber` to `biggestNumber`.  
- Otherwise, assign `secondNumber`.

The ternary expression is simply a compact way of writing the following code:

```javascript
let biggestNumber;
if (firstNumber > secondNumber) {
  biggestNumber = firstNumber;
} else {
  biggestNumber = secondNumber;
}
```
