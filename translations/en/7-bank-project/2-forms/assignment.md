# Style your bank app

## Instructions

Create a new `styles.css` file and link it to your current `index.html` file. In the CSS file you just created, add some styling to make the *Login* and *Dashboard* pages look neat and organized. Try to create a color theme to give your app its own unique branding.

> Tip: You can modify the HTML and add new elements and classes if necessary.
