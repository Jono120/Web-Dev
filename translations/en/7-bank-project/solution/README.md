# Bank app

> Example solution for the bank app project, created using plain HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries involved).

## Running the app

First, ensure the [API server](../api/README.md) is up and running.

You can use any web server to run the app, but since you should already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed to run the API, you can:

1. Clone this repository using Git.
2. Open a terminal, navigate to this directory, and run `npx lite-server .`. This will start a development web server on port `3000`.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the app.
